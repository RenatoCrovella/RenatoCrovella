### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
I am Renato Crovella (he/him/his), a Web and Gamedeveloper graduated in Marketing and specialized in Digital Marketing.
I'm currently living in Ireland, but I'm Italian-Brazilian and have moved recently to Europe after working 3 years at IBM. 
To pay the bills, I work as Student Coach at Pitman Training, but I'm planning to make a new move on my career and move back again to the IT industry - but not working in Marketing anymore, but with code!
I'm studying Web Development via Udemy and also working on my own RPG game using Unity and C#. I would love to be part of a growing and fast-paced company where I can collaborate with my Management, Digital Marketing and Communication skills. 
Fun fact: I wrote a book that was published on Amazon Kindle (only available in Portuguese, unfortunately =[ )
